# Gulp-4-set-up
Set up Gulp 4 in Wordpress on localhost using LESS preprocessor package and others. 

I decide to post this snippet code in other to share that for some beginners that might not know how to set up Gulp
for development purpose. 
To use it. it's not difficult at all, first download the code "the gulpfile.js and the package.json". 
create a folder in the theme folder and put those files. Run npm install, to install all the packages in the json file. Change 
"proxy   : "http://localhost/wilcoxtoyo" " to "http://localhost/your-folder-site-name". And change the path of files according to your folder theme structure.

### Notice:
##### Node.js and git should be installed first.
